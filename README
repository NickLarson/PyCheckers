--          THE BASICS         --
---------------------------------
//Current as of 8/27/2011 12:45 A.M.//

- The board will need to be an 8x8 board

- In this game, the user will NOT be forced to make a move resulting in a point if they have the opprotunity

- Positions 29-32 (inclusive) and 1-4 (inclusive) will be identified as a special type 'end'

- If the game determines that there are no legal moves for a player left, their turn will be skipped
  - If two consecutive turns are skipped, the game is a draw
  - If

- Pieces will initialize in alternating squares (every other square will be empty)

- The other end of the board will initialize the opposite side to fill in the inverse positions 
as the other side with pieces

- FEATURE: We will determine who gets to go first by doing a dice roll. 
  - The top pieces will be represented by a roll 1-5.  
  - The bottom pieces will be represented by a roll 6-10.

- Players get the opprotunity to move after their opponent has gone in an alternating fashion, 
starting from the first move made by the individual that wins the dice roll.

- An illegal move is categorized as one of the following:
  - Moving a piece backward that is not granted 'King' piece status
  - Moving a piece in any fashion other than kitty-corner (diagonal) fashion
  - Attempting to move a piece where another piece already is
  - Attempting to move a piece outside of the board

- A point will be gained if a user moves their piece and any of these conditions are met
  - The player makes a move to a position n+7 and an opposing piece was at position n+3
  - The player makes a move to a position n+9 and an opposing piece was at position n+4
  - The player makes a move to a position n-7 and an opposing piece was at position n-3
  - The player makes a move to a position n-9 and an opposing piece was at position n-4
  - The player makes a move to a position type 'end' and the following holds true:
    - absval((position-original) - (new-position)) = 7 or 9

- When a player has any of their pieces reach an opponent's 'end' the piece that reaches will be granted type 'king'

--           Classes         --
---------------------------------

- Board
  - This will be the board class that will hold data as necessary (should be abstract and moldable)

---------------------------------
--           Functions         --
---------------------------------

- StartRoll
  - This will be the roll that is started immediately after InitializeBoard that will determine who gets to go first
- PromptTurn
  - This will prompt the user to make their move depending on who's turn it is
